# RTL Design in Verilog using SKY130 Technology
## Workshop, 26-30th May 2021


### Project Scope

The workshop format comprises of hardware design in Verilog and follow along labs hosted by VSD-IAT on the cloud.  

The first day begins with an intro to digital design, and continues to illustrate various digital design steps such as simulation, <br/>validation by using a test bench (or stimulus file) in iverilog and logic Synthesis by using Yosys along with Sky's .lib file <br/>containing their cells and cells' features.

The second day continues with learning about Hierarchical vs Flat design, learning about flops, synchronous and asynchronous <br/>operation, alongside the techniques used in synthesis to account for phenomena such as stacked P-MOS vs stacked N-MOS.<br/> It further delves into hardware optimizations.


### Getting Started

You need one VM, preferrably running ubuntu, along with Kunal's vsdflow script which installs the necessary<br/> software stack; iVerilog for simulation, Yosys for synthesis, qRouter for routing.The workshop assumes some degree <br/>of basic familiarity with the Verilog Hardware Description Language, o if you don't know Verilog, this might not be <br/>the best place to start.
